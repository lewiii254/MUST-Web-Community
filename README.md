Welcome! This repository is dedicated to helping beginners learn fullstack web development using the **MERN** stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Whether you're just starting out or want to deepen your understanding, this project offers a week-by-week guided learning journey, practical code samples, and a supportive community.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each directory (`week-1`, `week-2`, etc.) containing focused lessons, code, and notes. Here’s a quick overview:

- `week-1/` – MongoDB basics, data modeling, and CRUD operations
- `week-2/` – Node.js & Express fundamentals: setting up servers, REST APIs
- `week-3/` – React basics: components, state, props, and UI building
- `week-4/` – Full stack integration: connecting backend and frontend
- `assets/` – Images, diagrams, or other media for documentation or tutorials
- `.env.example` – Example configuration for environment variables
- `package.json` – Project dependencies and scripts
- `README.md` – This file
- `LICENSE` – Open-source license (MIT)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – Contribution guidelines

## 🧑‍💻 Who Is This For?

- **Absolute beginners**: No prior experience in fullstack or JavaScript frameworks? This is for you!
- **Self-learners**: Each week is a self-contained module so you can learn at your own pace.
- **Students and educators**: Use this as a curriculum supplement or classroom resource.
- **Anyone new to MERN**: Gain hands-on, practical experience.

- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

## 🏁 Learning Path & Progress

The journey is divided into weekly modules:

| Week | Topic                      | Status  |
|------|----------------------------|---------|
| 1    | MongoDB basics             | ✅ Done |
| 2    | Node.js & Express          | 🔜 In Progress |
| 3    | React fundamentals         | ⏳ Upcoming |
| 4    | Full Stack Integration     | ⏳ Upcoming |

Each week builds on the previous. Start with week 1, and don’t hesitate to ask questions or open issues if you get stuck!
